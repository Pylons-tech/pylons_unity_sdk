# Pylons SDK for Unity (Examples) [![openupm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/com.pylons.unity.sdk.examples?label=openupm&registry_uri=https://package.openupm.com)](https://openupm.com/packages/com.pylons.unity.sdk.examples/)
> Example scripts utilizing the Pylons SDK for Unity

The Pylons SDK for Unity supplies developers with extensible, easy-to-use tools for communicating with a Pylons wallet from within
Unity, retrieving and managing data from the blockchain, and creating and submitting transactions.

This module provides an assortment of example scripts that show how one might use the APIs exposed by the Pylons SDK to perform various tasks.

**This is a preview release.** Efforts have been made to find and fix bugs and polish the available features, but new and exciting bugs
will definitely emerge when this package starts to see external use. Usability issues, too, are to be expected.
